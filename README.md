# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and data visualization using Power BI.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.  
   - Visualizations and summary statistics are included in `EDA.ipynb`.  

2. **Machine Learning Models:**  
   - **Linear Regression:** Implemented to predict total sales based on independent features in `LinearRegression.ipynb`.  
   - **Clustering:** Applied clustering techniques to segment the customer purchase behavior based on features such as monetary, recency and frequency of purchases, detailed in `Clustering.ipynb`.  

3. **Power BI Dashboard:**  
   - Created a visualization dashboard to present key insights derived from the clustered dataset in `PowerBIAnalysis.pbix`.

- **Source:** The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
